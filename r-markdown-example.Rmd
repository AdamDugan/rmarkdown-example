## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for 
authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R 
Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that 
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks 
within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r display}
glimpse(SwimRecords)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r scatplot, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = SwimRecords, 
  aes(x = year, y = time, color = sex)
) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = loess, se = FALSE) + 
  theme(legend.position = "right") + 
  labs(title = "100m Swimming Records over time") 
```

There are n=`r nrow(SwimRecords)` rows in the Swim records dataset.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` option was added to the code chunk to 
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
